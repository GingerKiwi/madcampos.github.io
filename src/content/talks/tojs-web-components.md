An intermediary level quick talk about Web Components. Starting with a basic example on how they work, then describing how to integrate them with forms and add accessibility.
Included on the talk there is a demo of a interface for a Game menu using tabs, inputs and cards; all of which are created using Web Components.
The last part goes through a couple caveats and features that are "not quite there".
